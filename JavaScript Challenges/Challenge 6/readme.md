# Challenge 6
## Goal of Challenge 6

- Dive into the nuances of Asynchronous JavaScript.
- Implement various methods for handling asynchronous operations.
- Simulate real-world asynchronous scenarios.

## Step 1: Asynchronous Building Blocks

### Timers
Create functions that showcase the usage of `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `clearInterval`. For instance, design a simple digital clock that updates every second.

### Promise Chains
Construct a series of promises that depend on each other's results. Demonstrate chaining with thenables and showcase error propagation.

### Callback Hell vs. Promises
Illustrate the problem of "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom" using nested callbacks. Then refactor this code to use promises for clearer, more readable logic.

## Step 2: Advanced Asynchronous Patterns

### Custom Promise Creation
Construct a custom promise that simulates a delayed operation. Add both resolve and reject scenarios and handle them appropriately when the promise is consumed.

### Generators & Promises
Create a generator function that yields promises. Use an external mechanism, like a button click, to progress through the generator's steps, showcasing how asynchronous operations can be paused and resumed.

### Async/Await with Error Handling
Fetch data from an API using the Fetch API combined with async/await. Incorporate try/catch/finally blocks to handle success, errors, and cleanup operations.

## Bonus Step: Real-world Challenges

### Concurrency with Promise.all
Fetch data from multiple endpoints concurrently using Promise.all. Display the combined data once all requests succeed.

### Async Iteration
Use for-await-of to asynchronously iterate over a set of promises, processing each one's result as it resolves.

### Implement a Throttle Function
Design a throttle function to limit the number of calls to an asynchronous function within a specific time frame.

Remember: Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is a core concept and can be complex, but with practice, it becomes intuitive.
Take breaks, consult resources, and enjoy the process of learning and coding!
