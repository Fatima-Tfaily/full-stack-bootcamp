# Challenge 5
## Goal of Challenge 5

- Advanced DOM Manipulations.
- Navigating DOM tree.
- Handling Multiple DOM events.

## Step 1: DOM Creation and Navigation

### DOM Element Creation
Create a new DOM element, a `<div>` with the class "container". Inside this, add a paragraph (`<p>`) with the text "Hello, World!".

### DOM Tree Navigation
Use JavaScript to select the "container" div and then navigate to its child elements, logging them to the console.

### Element Styling
Use JavaScript to change the background color of the "container" div to blue and the text color of the paragraph to white.

## Step 2: Event Handling

### Multiple Event Listeners
Create a button that changes color when you hover over it and reverts back when you move the mouse away. Implement this using two event listeners: `mouseover` and `mouseout`.

### Event Delegation
Add multiple buttons inside a container. Implement a single event listener on the container that listens for clicks on any button, and logs the text content of the clicked button. This should demonstrate the concept of event delegation.

### Form Data Extraction
Create a simple form with fields: "Name", "Email", and a "Submit" button. On submission, prevent the default form submission and instead, log the data entered by the user.

## Step 3: Advanced DOM Manipulations

### DOM Cloning
Select a DOM element and create an exact clone of it. Append this clone to the body.

### Element Removal
Add a button that, when clicked, removes a specified element from the DOM.

### Inserting Elements
Create functionality to insert a new DOM element after or before a specified element.
